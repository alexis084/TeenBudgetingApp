    Table Name: transactions
    Columns: amount     date        type        savingPercent
    Datatype: Real   Integer     Integer        Real
    Explanation:
        Amount is stored as a real (floating point) number
        Date is stored as an integer representing the date & time in unix time (easier to convert it to local time if stored as unix epoch or utc timestamp?)
        Type is stored as an integer of 0 or 1 to represent boolean values (sqlite doesn't have native boolean data type) 0 means deposit & 1 means withdrawal
        savingPercent is stored as a real (floating point) number that should be between 0.1 & 1 (check this in logic)
